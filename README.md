# What is a PetClinic ?

SpringSource has created a web application called [PetiClinic](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-petclinic/). Talked with [Michael Isvy](https://github.com/michaelisvy) and [Julien Dubois](https://github.com/jdubois) gave me the idea to port the application to Java EE. The idea is to have two similar web applications written in Spring and Java EE and check the differences.

# JBoss Forge

I've used [JBoss Forge](http://forge.jboss.org/) to bootstrap the application. It allows me to quickly have some Java EE code and scaffold a UI that I then change. You can check the generate.fsh script.
